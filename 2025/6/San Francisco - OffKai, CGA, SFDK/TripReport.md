# Background

Wow, this trip was noteworthy enough to make a GitHub folder of trip reports!

The idea for this trip came up through a couple of unrelated ideas all coalescing into a single goal. 

The first piece of the puzzle had been in place for a while: Cedar Fair had sold the land underneath California's Great America, with an order to have the park demolished within 10 years. This set a timer on me, and every year the writing is clearer on the wall. It's unknown whether the park cutting their seasonal events is related to chain-wide budget cuts, or another notice that the park's demise is imminent. Either way, I needed an excuse to get to northern California.

The second came to me out of the blue. My friend @Platypus_Mage reached out to me, asking if I would like to share a room with her at OffKai Expo. Platypus and I almost exclusively talk about vtubers nowadays, so it wasn't entirely unexpected for her to ask about going to the vtuber convention. I had only heard about the con experience from vtubers and cosplayers, so I had zero expectations of what I would experience as just a regular fan. Nevertheless, I felt like I should take the opportunity, and say yes to attending OffKai, if only for the ability to be in NorCal.

Finally, and probably the least important of my goals, is that I've been in a mood for IPAs recently, and being in San Jose would bring me closer to being able to try a Pliny the Elder Double IPA. It's a classic for those on the West Coast, but I would never be able to find it at home regularly.

# Trip Planning and Logistics

While coming up with what dates I would be in California, my parents called and told me they were planning on going on a hiking trip, starting on the Wednesday after OKE. This was perfect, as it meant that I could join them, and still visit the parks in California.

Since I want to keep my time off compact, I decided that I would work through the Thursday before OKE, and leave from work straight to the airport. I would then spend 3 days at the convention, then 1 day each at Great America and Discovery Kingdom. This would leave me flying home on Wednesday.

As for flights, I happened to find a flight from CLT to SFO at 7:15 on Thursday. With the plane time and time change, this would leave me getting to SFO at 9:15 or so. Not terrible, in my estimations, for leaving after a work day. As for a return flight, things got a little more tricky. The listed flights for a Wednesday return were either red eye flights, or the one I ended up selecting, which was at 1:15PM. Seeing as Discovery Kingdom was open until 9 on Tuesday, I thought I would appreciate sleeping in. In total, the two flights cost $313. I've lost all bearing on what a good flight price is, because prices are just higher when flying out of CLT. I looked into trying to fly out of Greensboro or RDU, or even fly into San Jose, but flights didn't really show up for the time I was looking for.

For the hotel at OKE, I left Platypus in charge of that one. I forget if she had already chosen the hotel when I told her I had no preference, but I honestly did not even know the address until the day I left. I was more busy organizing a future trip to Universal Orlando.

After being distracted by organizing group trips to Universal and Animazement, I could go back to focusing on the solo portion of my NorCal Vacation. This started with me trying to figure out the different public transport options, until I just plugged SFO - SJ Convention Center into Google Maps, and it showed me the public transit stops I would need to take, and that I could just load a clipper pass on my phone and pay for it with my phone's wallet app.

At first, I saw that Santa Clara, home of CGA, was right up the road from San Jose, so I could just take the train to the park for the day. However, I realized that I would have to find a place to store my bags, so I instead decided to just get a rental car. I would need a rental car for the leg leading to Discovery Kingdom, so I decided to look into rental car options. I balanced between picking up and dropping off both in SFO, but multiple sources told me not to. So instead, I looked for options to pick up the car in San Jose and drop it off at SFO. I decided to hold off on selecting my rental until closer to the day, when I knew my schedule a little bit more.

Finally, the hotels for myself. The obvious hotel to book would be for Vallejo, for Discovery Kingdom. Upon looking at the hotels, I realized that all of the lodging in Vallejo is motels. An interesting observation. Not as big a problem, since I would have a rental car, but still unexpected. I decided that I would be coming in the night before and leaving the morning after the Six Flags visit, so I would just get two nights. I believe it was $151 for the two night package at a Travel lodge close by.

Lastly, I decided to book a hotel for myself Sunday night. This was totally optional, but I felt like between my snoring and a lack of street parking, my best bet would be to get a hotel closer to Great America. I splurged a little and got a $200 hotel room, just to make sure I was well-rested for the two days ahead. I haven't gone to a multi-day con beyond Animazement, and every time I leave AZ, I feel so lucky I have that Monday off to recover.

# Thursday

It turns out that I didn't need to wait to fly out! Thursday happened to be Juneteenth, which meant that I didn't have to wait to fly out. With my flight being delayed 30 minutes, I almost wished that I had taken an earlier trip. The vibes of everywhere I looked suggested that I would be able to take public transit all the way to San Jose, but I would be cutting it close. The delay did me no favors.

I landed in California around 10PM. Seeing how late it was, I decided to just ball, taking public transit as far as I could.

I looked up the directions to the hotel on my phone, and it seemed like I could still make it with public transit, if I hit every stop on time. With this knowledge, I added a clipper pass to my phone and prepared for multiple transfers. Being able to pay with a single pass on my phone was _huge_, especially for the amount of distance covered.

I arrived at the hotel around 12:30AM, and after an awkward interaction getting checked in (I made it before Platypus), I was settled into the hotel room. Platypus wasn't far behind, arriving at 1AM. Despite the jet lag resulting in my biological time being nearly 4AM, I was stil alert enough to open the hotel door for Platypus and reach a relatively fine state of unpacking. We both finally settled into bed at around 2AM. It wasn't a great sleeping experience, with having to get used to the mattress, pillows, room temperature, and everything else, but at that point, I was just happy to go to sleep. Luckily, I didn't have anything on my schedule until the next day at 1PM, so I was free to sleep in as late as I wanted.

### Public Transit:
- SFO Airport Rail
- BART: SFO - Millbrae
- CalTrain: Millbrae - San Jose Diridon

$13.20 Fare (had to load $20, as CalTrain refunds you after you get off. Had to pay $12.20 to get on the train, and got refunded $4.50)

# Friday

For some reason, I woke up at 8AM. I guess, even though I was up ridiculously late, my body still wanted to wake up at a "reasonable" hour. Since Platypus had things to do in the morning, I decided to cut my losses and go get breakfast while she got ready. I had nothing on my schedule until the Lazuli M&G at 1, so I initially planned to just hang around the hotel room, until I remembered two things I needed to do in the morning: pick up a charger for my earbuds, and pick up my convention badge. I didn't want to make Platypus follow me on the detour, so I went alone. I walked to the 7-Eleven down the street from the hotel, where I was greeted with nothing I wanted. 

I was quickly introduced to the concept of public places in California not having publically available restrooms. This is devastating for me, because it adds a layer of planning to every stop I make. I do understand the position, however, because it's a huge headache for a business to maintain a public restroom. Luckily, I wasn't planning on being in too many public spaces during this trip, so it didn't affect me much.

Oh, and also, the convenience store didn't have a micro-USB cable. I wish we didn't live in an age where people are still manufacturing these devices with the outdated connection.

Anyway, I arrived at the convention center just after 10AM, and got into the inevitable line for badges. I was surprised at the length of the line to pick up badges. I guess not as many people got to utilize the national holiday the day before to pick up ther badge early. However, the check in process was easy - they just needed to scan my ID! Much better than having to download an app for a QR code or making the desk worker look up my name.

The convention opening was quite the experience. I was still in the mindset of wasting time until 1:00, but there weren't any panels at that time that interested me. Instead, I decided to walk around and admire the convention center. The second floor was nothing but lines. Everyone was waiting in line for something.

I think this is a good time to talk about lines at OffKai. For this convention, the staff decided 
to change up how lines are organized. Instead of your typical line bunching up like the first diagram, where everyone follows in order, they made multiple parallel lines, and admitted each line in order:

```
A      * A B C
| /-\  * | | |
| | |  * | | |
| | |  * | | |
| | |  * | | |
\_/ |  * | | |
```

Then, if the lines wrapped around the corner, they would create more lines around the corner.

```
A B C
| | |
| | |
| | |
      D ------
      E ------
```

This is smart, because it reduces the number of line jumps from cutting corners, and also saves more space for people to walk around. However, my big problem with this system is that everything is unlabelled. You don't know which line is A, B, or C unless there is someone actively marking where the end of the line is. Additionally, you don't know where lines D or E are unless someone is pointing it out to you. It makes the experience of getting in line stressful, because you can't tell from a glance how long the line is going to be. There were a few times where I started to get in line for something over the weekend, just to see that lines D and E exist, and bailed.

This is all to say that my first thing I did at the con was head to the back of the hall and randomly choose 1 of 2 lines to get in. This is probably where I got the best sense of everyone there, as the back room of the convention center held the lines for the artist's alley and the industry hall. There were _so_ many people there, all dressed in different outfits and cosplays. I could have just entertained myself for a couple hours looking around. However, once 11:00 rolled around, the industry hall opened up, and I slowly made my way in.

I thought my first stop for the industry hall would be the Kawa Entertainment booth, to pick up the Lazuli birthday merchandise I pre-ordered. That booth was a little flooded, between people shopping for merch and people waiting for the first M&Gs. Failing that, I decided to check out the GlitchStars booth, to potentially sign up for a M&G there. Platypus and I were discussing it the night before, and with each talent taking 2 minutes per M&G, limited to 60 minutes total, the odds were not looking good. Since we were both unable to find places to sign up for the M&Gs online before the convention, I thought I would be able to sign up for a slot in person. That booth was crowded, so I just assumed that I would not be able to get a slot. At that point, I decided to check out the other booths.

The rest of the industry hall was pretty cool. Two gamer hydration brands, a few corporations, some vtuber apps, and a random assortment of other brands that had connections to vtubers. I was interested in the BART booth, but it looked like they were still setting up when I came by. I thought it was a bit strange that Phase Connect was able to reserve the entire left side of the room, when they didn't end up using all the space. Like, they gained points back in my book by using the back corner to hold space for the lines, but the front part of the booth, with the standees, just felt like empty space. Could it have been a staging area? 

After a couple laps around the industry hall, I stepped outside for some fresh air. On my way out, I saw an older woman, wearing orange, taking a selfie with the MomAtCookieBox standee, which she was about the same height as. Surely she wouldn't be that obvious? When I got outside, I noticed that the artist alley line was still filtering through. Given that information, I decided to give up and go get lunch, since I didn't know when I would be getting food next.

This brings me to my biggest failure of the weekend, which is that I am hyper-aware of the parasocial divide between the VTuber and the fan, and it makes initiating a conversation hard for me. Outside of Lazuli, I don't make it a point to watch specific VTubers every time they stream. I do watch Kanna, Hina, Dizzy, Bri, and Mako whenever they're live, but I don't feel like I'm in their top-tier fans. I know most VTubers have a good memory of who is in their chat, so they would probably recognize me by name, but beyond that, the conversation would be one-way. What else could I talk about, other than "I like this one facet of what you do!" I also don't want to test boundaries with a hug or a photo, and mess up whatever plans they had. I think Bri did it best when she just went on Twitter and said "I will be there. I will post my outfits. Please say hi. I will give you a ribbon. Please DNI with my friends unless they ask." Safe to say, I spent my entire lunch brainstorming what to have a conversation about with Luli. 

I had a Tofu and Egg Banh Mi sandwich. I thought the tofu was going to be lightly seasoned, but it had a full-flavor sauce about it. While it was good, it did clash with the light-tasting sandwich I expected. I always make it a point to get Vietnamese food when I go out west. Quality may have caught up out east in the last couple of years, but it just hit different the last couple times I went to Denver, and especially hit different in California.

After lunch, I returned to the industry hall to get in line for literally the only thing I had planned, the Lazuli M&G. In line, I was finally able to meet up with the lads! I'll put a full list of the lads I met some point later in this document. However, the M&G was a lot of fun! The 90 seconds put a lot of pressure on me, but the relaxed nature of all of the staff really put me at ease. Lazuli, if you're reading this, the ice cream guy was gone by the next time I left the building! But don't worry, I did get ice cream later!

After picking up my pre-ordered merch, I decided to make one more attempt at the artists alley. I was discouraged when I saw a huge line out front, but after walking down a little ways, I noticed that people were freely walking in and out through the other doors, so I followed them in. I didn't expect the itasha showcase to be right there inside the AA, so I took a minute to appreciate the cars. I don't really care about cars from a mechanical perspective, but I really enjoyed the lengths these people took to make sure that the art would be perfectly cropped. I don't have much to say on the artists alley itself, because it was pretty much what one would expect. I bought a bunch of stuff.

After getting out of the artists alley, I spent some time reading the con information book. Checking the schedule inside of it, I locked in on going to Umi Kyoku's visual EP panel... thing. I used to watch Umi regularly, but I fell off of following her a while ago. If she's recapping the last few songs she released, I thought it would be the perfect time to go see it. Given that the time was around 1:40, and the show was at 8, I needed to fill my time with some other things. The Phase Connect show was at 3, so I decided to check out the board game library until then.

## California's Great America 

### Demon

Something about the old Arrow trains just makes it so you can't brace for a ride on the first try. You have to learn how to ride the ride to avoid the pain. However, once you do learn how to brace for it, it's got some pretty good elements. 

The tunnels at the start of the ride and after the loops are cute. You pull some pretty good forces at the bottoms of the loops, and a pinch of airtime at the peaks. The transition into the corkscrews absolutely sucks as usual, but the sheer perfection of being inside the corkscrews is unrivaled. The good parts of the ride have a hard time overcoming the sheer jank of the transitions, but as an avid defender of Carolina Cyclone, I'll step up to bat for Demon.

Plus, the theming on the ride is really good for a ride of that age. The deep shifted voice of the safety announcement, the tunnels, and the tree coverage all combine to make a charming experience surpassed only by the Loch Ness Monster.

### Flight Deck

Demon may be able to get away with not having a station roof due to the tree coverage, but this lack of shade is extremely apparent on Flight Deck. The queue itself has some pretty good theming, getting you in the Navy fighter pilot headspace, but when you get to the station, you're reminded that you are at a Six Flags park. The most aggregious part of the station experience is that they do try to inject some theming by playing a relevant soundtrack, but one of the speakers set up to provide the stereo experience has a short in it, meaning that any time the train enters or leaves the station, the sound cuts in and out, which hurts what little immersion is left.

However, since this is a coaster in the Six Flags chain, we have to set that aside and judge this ride on its elements. And here is where I drop the act, and come clean that I was comparing this ride to Afterburn from the start. These two rides are the same model, from the same era, from the same park chain, with the same original theme. Even in the on-ride experience, you can't help but feel that the elements are very similar, albeit Flight Deck missing the main attraction (the batwing). The first drop is fun, whipping you to the side while it builds up speed, leading to a beautifully built up vertical loop that maintains its positive forces the whole way through. The first major diversion Flight Deck takes is putting in a helix right after the first loop. I get that this is probably to help the ride burn of speed (and extend the super short ride time), but a helix this early in the ride makes it feel like the ride is already trying to find its way to the end. Maybe it could have taken a cue from Afterburn and included another inversion, like a sidewinder, and just installed trim brakes afterwards. Inverted coasters are best when they are performing inversions, so I don't see why they didn't. They still did the best with what they had, though, and the helix does provide good Gs.

After the first helix, the zero-G roll is perfectly executed, as they are on other B&M inverts. The s-bend over the station doesn't do much, but it is a way to get prepared for the finale. This finale is the exact same as the one on Afterburn, with the added bonus of the water below. I knew the corkscrew was coming, so I was able to brace for it, and it was just as forceful as I thought it would be. Same with the final helix, providing some of the best Gs on the ride. However, with the water so close below, it's so much cooler. You can see the ripples below you as you pass by, and you hope that you don't fall into the water at the end of the corkscrew.

I can't dislike this ride. It's smooth and forceful, and gives exactly the intended experience.

### Patriot

The final of the trio of coasters without a station building, this coaster makes me question why mid B&M coasters from the early 90s don't get the same nostalgia factor as mid Arrow coasters from the late 80s. Like, this coaster doesn't suck any more than rides like Demon and Corkscrew, but I have less thoughts on this ride than Demon.

Basically, the first drop and loop are great. The ride's turns and helices are executed well enough, but they felt more meandering than made to provide forces. The corkscrew feels like it does on the other early B&Ms. Not much going on otherwise.

For its mildness, the ride is still photogenic. I like how the ride doesn't have a rectangular layout. The paths are strategically placed around the ride in such a way that you can't really see all of the coaster at once from anywhere in the park, which makes it feel bigger. This also means that there are multiple prime viewing locations for the ride, each showing off a different element of the coaster. Kind of like Kumba, or Goliath (over Georgia). It makes the ride experience more mysterious, because you don't know how all of the elements are going to be ordered, like a ride that can entirely fit in a single photo.
