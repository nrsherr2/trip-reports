# Background

Wow, this trip was noteworthy enough to make a GitHub folder of trip reports!

The idea for this trip came up through a couple of unrelated ideas all coalescing into a single goal. 

The first piece of the puzzle had been in place for a while: Cedar Fair had sold the land underneath California's Great America, with an order to have the park demolished within 10 years. This set a timer on me, and every year the writing is clearer on the wall. It's unknown whether the park cutting their seasonal events is related to chain-wide budget cuts, or another notice that the park's demise is imminent. Either way, I needed an excuse to get to northern California.

The second came to me out of the blue. My friend @Platypus_Mage reached out to me, asking if I would like to share a room with her at OffKai Expo. Platypus and I almost exclusively talk about vtubers nowadays, so it wasn't entirely unexpected for her to ask about going to the vtuber convention. I had only heard about the con experience from vtubers and cosplayers, so I had zero expectations of what I would experience as just a regular fan. Nevertheless, I felt like I should take the opportunity, and say yes to attending OffKai, if only for the ability to be in NorCal.

Finally, and probably the least important of my goals, is that I've been in a mood for IPAs recently, and being in San Jose would bring me closer to being able to try a Pliny the Elder Double IPA. It's a classic for those on the West Coast, but I would never be able to find it at home regularly.

# Trip Planning and Logistics

While coming up with what dates I would be in California, my parents called and told me they were planning on going on a hiking trip, starting on the Wednesday after OKE. This was perfect, as it meant that I could join them, and still visit the parks in California.

Since I want to keep my time off compact, I decided that I would work through the Thursday before OKE, and leave from work straight to the airport. I would then spend 3 days at the convention, then 1 day each at Great America and Discovery Kingdom. This would leave me flying home on Wednesday.

As for flights, I happened to find a flight from CLT to SFO at 7:15 on Thursday. With the plane time and time change, this would leave me getting to SFO at 9:15 or so. Not terrible, in my estimations, for leaving after a work day. As for a return flight, things got a little more tricky. The listed flights for a Wednesday return were either red eye flights, or the one I ended up selecting, which was at 1:15PM. Seeing as Discovery Kingdom was open until 9 on Tuesday, I thought I would appreciate sleeping in. In total, the two flights cost $313. I've lost all bearing on what a good flight price is, because prices are just higher when flying out of CLT. I looked into trying to fly out of Greensboro or RDU, or even fly into San Jose, but flights didn't really show up for the time I was looking for.

For the hotel at OKE, I left Platypus in charge of that one. I forget if she had already chosen the hotel when I told her I had no preference, but I honestly did not even know the address until the day I left. I was more busy organizing a future trip to Universal Orlando.

After being distracted by organizing group trips to Universal and Animazement, I could go back to focusing on the solo portion of my NorCal Vacation. This started with me trying to figure out the different public transport options, until I just plugged SFO - SJ Convention Center into Google Maps, and it showed me the public transit stops I would need to take, and that I could just load a clipper pass on my phone and pay for it with my phone's wallet app.

At first, I saw that Santa Clara, home of CGA, was right up the road from San Jose, so I could just take the train to the park for the day. However, I realized that I would have to find a place to store my bags, so I instead decided to just get a rental car. I would need a rental car for the leg leading to Discovery Kingdom, so I decided to look into rental car options. I balanced between picking up and dropping off both in SFO, but multiple sources told me not to. So instead, I looked for options to pick up the car in San Jose and drop it off at SFO. I decided to hold off on selecting my rental until closer to the day, when I knew my schedule a little bit more.

Finally, the hotels for myself. The obvious hotel to book would be for Vallejo, for Discovery Kingdom. Upon looking at the hotels, I realized that all of the lodging in Vallejo is motels. An interesting observation. Not as big a problem, since I would have a rental car, but still unexpected. I decided that I would be coming in the night before and leaving the morning after the Six Flags visit, so I would just get two nights. I believe it was $151 for the two night package at a Travel lodge close by.

Lastly, I decided to book a hotel for myself Sunday night. This was totally optional, but I felt like between my snoring and a lack of street parking, my best bet would be to get a hotel closer to Great America. I splurged a little and got a $200 hotel room, just to make sure I was well-rested for the two days ahead. I haven't gone to a multi-day con beyond Animazement, and every time I leave AZ, I feel so lucky I have that Monday off to recover.

# Thursday

It turns out that I didn't need to wait to fly out! Thursday happened to be Juneteenth, which meant that I didn't have to wait to fly out. With my flight being delayed 30 minutes, I almost wished that I had taken an earlier trip. The vibes of everywhere I looked suggested that I would be able to take public transit all the way to San Jose, but I would be cutting it close. The delay did me no favors.

I landed in California around 10PM. Seeing how late it was, I decided to just ball, taking public transit as far as I could.

I looked up the directions to the hotel on my phone, and it seemed like I could still make it with public transit, if I hit every stop on time. With this knowledge, I added a clipper pass to my phone and prepared for multiple transfers. Being able to pay with a single pass on my phone was _huge_, especially for the amount of distance covered.

I arrived at the hotel just after midnight, and after an awkward interaction getting checked in (I made it before Platypus), I was settled into the hotel room.

### Public Transit:

## California's Great America 

### Demon

Something about the old Arrow trains just makes it so you can't brace for a ride on the first try. You have to learn how to ride the ride to avoid the pain. However, once you do learn how to brace for it, it's got some pretty good elements. 

The tunnels at the start of the ride and after the loops are cute. You pull some pretty good forces at the bottoms of the loops, and a pinch of airtime at the peaks. The transition into the corkscrews absolutely sucks as usual, but the sheer perfection of being inside the corkscrews is unrivaled. The good parts of the ride have a hard time overcoming the sheer jank of the transitions, but as an avid defender of Carolina Cyclone, I'll step up to bat for Demon.

Plus, the theming on the ride is really good for a ride of that age. The deep shifted voice of the safety announcement, the tunnels, and the tree coverage all combine to make a charming experience surpassed only by the Loch Ness Monster.

### Flight Deck

Demon may be able to get away with not having a station roof due to the tree coverage, but this lack of shade is extremely apparent on Flight Deck. The queue itself has some pretty good theming, getting you in the Navy fighter pilot headspace, but when you get to the station, you're reminded that you are at a Six Flags park. The most aggregious part of the station experience is that they do try to inject some theming by playing a relevant soundtrack, but one of the speakers set up to provide the stereo experience has a short in it, meaning that any time the train enters or leaves the station, the sound cuts in and out, which hurts what little immersion is left.

However, since this is a coaster in the Six Flags chain, we have to set that aside and judge this ride on its elements. And here is where I drop the act, and come clean that I was comparing this ride to Afterburn from the start. These two rides are the same model, from the same era, from the same park chain, with the same original theme. Even in the on-ride experience, you can't help but feel that the elements are very similar, albeit Flight Deck missing the main attraction (the batwing). The first drop is fun, whipping you to the side while it builds up speed, leading to a beautifully built up vertical loop that maintains its positive forces the whole way through. The first major diversion Flight Deck takes is putting in a helix right after the first loop. I get that this is probably to help the ride burn of speed (and extend the super short ride time), but a helix this early in the ride makes it feel like the ride is already trying to find its way to the end. Maybe it could have taken a cue from Afterburn and included another inversion, like a sidewinder, and just installed trim brakes afterwards. Inverted coasters are best when they are performing inversions, so I don't see why they didn't. They still did the best with what they had, though, and the helix does provide good Gs.

After the first helix, the zero-G roll is perfectly executed, as they are on other B&M inverts. The s-bend over the station doesn't do much, but it is a way to get prepared for the finale. This finale is the exact same as the one on Afterburn, with the added bonus of the water below. I knew the corkscrew was coming, so I was able to brace for it, and it was just as forceful as I thought it would be. Same with the final helix, providing some of the best Gs on the ride. However, with the water so close below, it's so much cooler. You can see the ripples below you as you pass by, and you hope that you don't fall into the water at the end of the corkscrew.

I can't dislike this ride. It's smooth and forceful, and gives exactly the intended experience.
