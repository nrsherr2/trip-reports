# Background

Wow, this trip was noteworthy enough to make a GitHub folder of trip reports!

The idea for this trip came up through a couple of unrelated ideas all coalescing into a single goal. 

The first piece of the puzzle had been in place for a while: Cedar Fair had sold the land underneath California's Great America, with an order to have the park demolished within 10 years. This set a timer on me, and every year the writing is clearer on the wall. It's unknown whether the park cutting their seasonal events is related to chain-wide budget cuts, or another notice that the park's demise is imminent. Either way, I needed an excuse to get to northern California.

The second came to me out of the blue. My friend @Platypus_Mage reached out to me, asking if I would like to share a room with her at OffKai Expo. Platypus and I almost exclusively talk about vtubers nowadays, so it wasn't entirely unexpected for her to ask about going to the vtuber convention. I had only heard about the con experience from vtubers and cosplayers, so I had zero expectations of what I would experience as just a regular fan. Nevertheless, I felt like I should take the opportunity, and say yes to attending OffKai, if only for the ability to be in NorCal.

Finally, and probably the least important of my goals, is that I've been in a mood for IPAs recently, and being in San Jose would bring me closer to being able to try a Pliny the Elder Double IPA. It's a classic for those on the West Coast, but I would never be able to find it at home regularly.

# Trip Planning and Logistics

While coming up with what dates I would be in California, my parents called and told me they were planning on going on a hiking trip, starting on the Wednesday after OKE. This was perfect, as it meant that I could join them, and still visit the parks in California.

Since I want to keep my time off compact, I decided that I would work through the Thursday before OKE, and leave from work straight to the airport. I would then spend 3 days at the convention, then 1 day each at Great America and Discovery Kingdom. This would leave me flying home on Wednesday.

As for flights, I happened to find a flight from CLT to SFO at 7:15 on Thursday. With the plane time and time change, this would leave me getting to SFO at 9:15 or so. Not terrible, in my estimations, for leaving after a work day. As for a return flight, things got a little more tricky. The listed flights for a Wednesday return were either red eye flights, or the one I ended up selecting, which was at 1:15PM. Seeing as Discovery Kingdom was open until 9 on Tuesday, I thought I would appreciate sleeping in. In total, the two flights cost $313. I've lost all bearing on what a good flight price is, because prices are just higher when flying out of CLT. I looked into trying to fly out of Greensboro or RDU, or even fly into San Jose, but flights didn't really show up for the time I was looking for.

For the hotel at OKE, I left Platypus in charge of that one. I forget if she had already chosen the hotel when I told her I had no preference, but I honestly did not even know the address until the day I left. I was more busy organizing a future trip to Universal Orlando.

After being distracted by organizing group trips to Universal and Animazement, I could go back to focusing on the solo portion of my NorCal Vacation. This started with me trying to figure out the different public transport options, until I just plugged SFO - SJ Convention Center into Google Maps, and it showed me the public transit stops I would need to take, and that I could just load a clipper pass on my phone and pay for it with my phone's wallet app.

At first, I saw that Santa Clara, home of CGA, was right up the road from San Jose, so I could just take the train to the park for the day. However, I realized that I would have to find a place to store my bags, so I instead decided to just get a rental car. I would need a rental car for the leg leading to Discovery Kingdom, so I decided to look into rental car options. I balanced between picking up and dropping off both in SFO, but multiple sources told me not to. So instead, I looked for options to pick up the car in San Jose and drop it off at SFO. I decided to hold off on selecting my rental until closer to the day, when I knew my schedule a little bit more.

Finally, the hotels for myself. The obvious hotel to book would be for Vallejo, for Discovery Kingdom. Upon looking at the hotels, I realized that all of the lodging in Vallejo is motels. An interesting observation. Not as big a problem, since I would have a rental car, but still unexpected. I decided that I would be coming in the night before and leaving the morning after the Six Flags visit, so I would just get two nights. I believe it was $151 for the two night package at a Travel lodge close by.

Lastly, I decided to book a hotel for myself Sunday night. This was totally optional, but I felt like between my snoring and a lack of street parking, my best bet would be to get a hotel closer to Great America. I splurged a little and got a $200 hotel room, just to make sure I was well-rested for the two days ahead. I haven't gone to a multi-day con beyond Animazement, and every time I leave AZ, I feel so lucky I have that Monday off to recover.

### Demon

Something about the old Arrow trains just makes it so you can't brace for a ride on the first try. You have to learn how to ride the ride to avoid the pain. However, once you do learn how to brace for it, it's got some pretty good elements. 
The tunnels at the start of the ride and after the loops are cute. You pull some pretty good forces at the bottoms of the loops, and a pinch of airtime at the peaks. The transition into the corkscrews absolutely sucks as usual, but the sheer perfection of being inside the corkscrews is unrivaled.
- 7/10 the ride is a janky mess, but the theming and charm of the ride absolutely hold it up.
