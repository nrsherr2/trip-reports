# Background

This one is pretty simple. Epic Universe is opening. Stardust Racers. Monsters Unchained. Donkey Kong. With all the new theme parks opening in Asia looking amazing, seeing a new major theme park open in Orlando is a momentous occasion. 

This trip is mainly built around the idea that when tickets for Epic Universe were first going on sale, you could only buy them with multi-day park passes to Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios. Since it has been nearly 15 years since the last time I went to Universal, I feel like this is going to be the all-in trip. I got a 3 day pass, so that I can take my time and enjoy the other two parks. I chose to stay at a Universal resort, so I could take the bus to the park, and not have to contend with the (admittedly impressive) parking garage. I'm scheduling the trip in a slower part of the year to avoid crowds.

Most importantly, I invited my college roommates on the trip. Cynically, this is a way to save money. Outside of that, it's just good to spend time with friends. If I'm going to make this a top-tier trip, I shouldn't go alone. Enjoying experiences with people is what makes the trip special, and these 3 guys make the trips amazing. Even if we burn ourselves out with too many rides in the morning, we're still going to be hanging out together. Since leaving college, we've all spread out to different parts of the country, and spending time online together is not the same. It's always important, with these kinds of relationships, to make sure you make time to be together. Plus, I've already spoiled myself on practically everything at Epic Universe, so I want to experience the surprises through everyone else's eyes.
